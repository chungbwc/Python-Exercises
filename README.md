 Exercises with Python in Art & Design

This is the software repository for my personal exercises with the Python programming language. The focus is in the Art and Design areas with the common libraries of [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news), [Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org), [MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org).
